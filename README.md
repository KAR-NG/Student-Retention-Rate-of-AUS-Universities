# Student Retention Rate of AUS Universities

**Summary**

This project analyses the statistics of retention, attrition and success rate of Universities in Australia with a focus on the University of Queensland (UQ). Data set used in this project is a publicly available data set downloaded from the website of the Department of Education, Skills and Employment (DESE), Australia Government. The insights of this project are based on statistics in 2019 and 2020. Years will be specified in graphs.

Imported raw data were very messy. A series of carefully-designed data processing techniques were applied to clean and transform the data. There are 7 visualisation tasks in this project. Most of the tasks were accomplished using customised visualisation techniques and the last task was analysed by one of the principal component methods, called principal component analysis, it is known as “PCA” to analyse the multivariate data set as a whole for trend mining purposes.

Result shows that the performance of attrition, retention and success of all states in Australia were not too different from each other, but rank-able. Based on the average value, Queensland ranked the third in attrition rate, the third last in retention and success rates.

However, the University of Queensland (UQ) was performing well in 2019 and 2020 in terms of these statistics, both nation-wide or state-wide. In state-wide comparison based on average, UQ had the lowest attrition rate, highest retention rate, and the second highest in student success rate (outcompeted by Bond University in Gold Coast. In nation-wide comparison based on average, UQ ranked the 32th in attrition rate (out of 41 universities in the data set), ranked the 11th in retention rate, and ranked the 20th in success rate. The outputs of PCA show that attrition rate is negatively associated to retention rate, success rate has no association with attrition rate but little to none association with retention rate. Most universities in Australia are doing good as they located in the same direction of success and retention rates but there are a few underperforming universities are associated with high attrition rate.
